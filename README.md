fips-glfw
=========

fipsified GLFW (https://github.com/glfw/glfw)

fips build system: https://github.com/floooh/fips

**NOTE 29-Oct-2017**

On MacOS, GLFW now defaults to HighDPI rendering on Retina displays.
To get the old behaviour, set the ```GLFW_COCOA_RETINA_FRAMEBUFFER```
window hint to ```GLFW_FALSE```.

Oryol does this automatically.
